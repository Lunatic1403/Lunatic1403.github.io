            <ul>
                <span class="list-no-indent">The instruction set of a CPU is the list of instructions which it is able to decode</span><br>
                <span class="list-no-indent">There are two main approaches to the architecture of processor:</span>
                <li><strong>Reduced Instruction Set Computers</strong> (<strong>RISC</strong>)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>These processors use simple instructions, which can be executed within a single clock cycle</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Complex Instruction Set Computers</strong> (<strong>CISC</strong>)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>These processors have a much larger instruction set than RISC processors, allowing more tasks to be accomplished by as few lines of assembly code as possible. However, as these instructions are more complex, they may take multiple FDE cycles to execute.</li>
